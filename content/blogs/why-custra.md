In every meeting or online class, the hardest part is not the content — it's keeping up. Slides flip, demos move fast, and key conclusions appear for just a few seconds. Your attention gets split between listening, taking screenshots, and trying to keep decent notes.

CUSTRA is a local-first capture assistant. You select a region inside a Zoom / Teams / Tencent Meeting window or a live stream — slides, subtitles, chat, or any part of the screen — and CUSTRA samples it once per second, comparing each frame with the last saved one. When the view changes meaningfully, it saves a new PNG; optional loop capture can save every N seconds as a safety net. On Windows, you can also capture system audio.

The result is not a huge video file. It's a clean folder of time-stamped images (and an optional audio file) that match the rhythm of the session — perfect for review and note-taking.

## The problem CUSTRA solves

In real meetings and classes, the pain point is rarely "no content". It's "I couldn't capture the important parts in time". You're:

- Listening while the presenter flips through slides, demos, and key conclusions.
- Trying to screenshot and take notes at the same time, splitting your attention.
- Scrubbing through chat logs or recordings afterwards, just to find one specific page.

CUSTRA is designed to reduce that friction: you set it up once per session, then stay focused on the speaker while it quietly captures the key frames for you.

## Why CUSTRA is different

- Less manual work: from "N manual screenshots" to "select once, pick up the results in output/ afterwards".
- Fewer junk images: only save when the content changes (plus optional loop capture), so the output matches the real pace of the session.
- Local-first privacy: no account, no upload. Files stay on your machine and under your control.

## Typical scenarios

- Online courses / bootcamps: slides, code examples, and whiteboard content change frequently — keep the key pages automatically.
- Zoom / Teams / Tencent Meeting: shared screens, design reviews, product demos — keep a visual record of important points.
- Live streams / public talks: subtitles, title cards, and key explanations for easier recap or content creation.
- Interviews / remote demo calls: preserve key flows and pages as local evidence (with consent and compliance in mind).
- Book clubs / study groups: capture changing pages in shared documents so you can revisit them along a timeline.

## Who CUSTRA is for

- Students and exam takers: automatically collect key slides and worked examples from online courses.
- Professionals: reduce the mental load of screenshotting during weekly meetings, reviews, trainings, and town halls.
- Instructors and TAs: quickly locate "that slide" when answering questions or reviewing course pacing.
- Content creators: capture key frames from live or recorded sessions for editing and repurposing.
- Researchers and consultants: organize visual material from online sessions, while staying within compliance.

## How CUSTRA works

- Click to start CUSTRA.
- Drag to select a region on screen (slides, subtitles, chat, etc.).
- The first frame is always saved.
- Every second, CUSTRA samples the region and compares it with the last saved frame.
- Two save rules: change-triggered saving, and optional loop capture that saves every N seconds as a fallback.
- When you stop, CUSTRA automatically archives the session into a task folder with images (and optional audio).

## Feature highlights

- Minimal controls: a handful of buttons (start, audio, settings) so you can learn it in seconds.
- Multi-monitor aware: capture stays on the screen where you select, without crossing monitors.
- Timestamped filenames: include system time (with timezone and milliseconds) and in-session timing for easier alignment with notes.
- Optional Windows system audio capture: a single audio.wav per task, so you can replay important segments.
- Tray-friendly: can run in the system tray without taking up taskbar space.

## Privacy & data

- No uploads: outputs are written to a local output/ directory.
- You stay in control: delete, copy, encrypt, or archive the files however you like.

CUSTRA exists so you can stop splitting your attention between screenshotting and listening — and still walk away with a clean, reviewable record of what mattered.
